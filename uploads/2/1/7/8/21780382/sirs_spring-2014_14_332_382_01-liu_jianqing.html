<p><strong>What do you like best about this course?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>it&#039;s a recitation</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The TA was very helpful and supportive that I enjoyed learning from the TA which kept me to stay in this course.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The material that is covered</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>It&#039;s interesting, and very different from a typical engineering course.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The approachability of Jianqing, always willing to help and wants the best for the students in the class which made the learning process much more enjoyable.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Not many of the other electrical and computer engineering courses include physics. Most of them are on circuit analysis and computer programming. It&#039;s nice to have a course that teaches the physics behind the components on circuits we design.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Going over hw is essentially impossible because it&#039;s too long to cover in 1 hour 20 minutes.. Gives solutions to students and explain certain problems the students need help with;.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Recitation and outside classroom availability</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>How electricity and magnetism was figured out. Start from very beginning. One must start from basics to masters the more modern</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>good review of homework</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Although challenging, this course equips you with a very satisfactory set of tools to investigate engineering problems.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Has a lot of interesting topics</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The TA was extremely helpful</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>If you were teaching this course, what would you do differently?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>nothing</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The TA is great! </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The TA actually did problems during recitation and helped us learn unlike the professor who most of times got off topic and barely did problems in lecture. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Instead of going through every homework problem, pick the important ones and go over them with a lot of detail. Often times we ran out of time during recitation and did not get to do some of the later problems which often turned out to be the more involved problems.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would have the homework make us explain concepts. This way students will be forced to take the time to really understand what is going on. I always wanted to take the time to understand, but other courses would also have work due that too precedence.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Only hindrance in this course is the professor. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Curve the class from the beginning :(</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Nothing. TA was very well prepared for the lectures! He knows his stuff!</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Nothing</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would go over homework problems more in depth. Instead of going through half the steps when solving a practice and then assuming the students can do the rest on their own, I would go through every step slowly. I know the class was short on time but going through each and every step in it&#039;s entirety would be more beneficial for when students are studying for an exam</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>In what ways, if any, has this course or the instructor encouraged your intellectual growth and progress?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>I can tackle difficult problems and relate to real world problems</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He showed a lot of interest in helping the students which gave me the drive to keep on learning</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The TA answered any questions we had sincerely and in a welcoming way</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Been very helpful with his explanations on the homework problems. He really clarified things well for us.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Whenever the homework sets were reviewed, an example of a potential real world application was given and it definitely helps to put things into perspective.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I normally shy away from learning things in a procedural manner because it makes me feel like I don&#039;t know what&#039;s really happening in the problem. But in this course, I learned that you can use what you know to understand the steps, and then use those basic steps to solve the problem, which makes problem solving much easier.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He was actually prepared for class. This is a job and he took it seriously, unlike 90% of other TA&#039;s in the department. Good for him.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>TA has this little tricks that really helps visualizing in 3d compared to the professor</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He made it clear that only knowing how to do the assigned problems was not enough to gain a clear understanding of the course material.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The TA was very helpful and as a result I was able to grasp a majority of the concepts. I think if I had the chance to go to more office hours I would of. Unfortunately I had such a busy schedule this semester</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>Other comments or suggestions:</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>Jian Qing is one of the best TA&#039;s I&#039;ve ever had. He&#039;s great at explaining the topics and answering questions during recitations, grades fairly, and is understanding and flexible with students. I hope he receives many TA positions in the future, and also hope to have him as a TA again.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>none</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He&#039;s a good TA . No changes needed.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Best TA</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Jian Qing was the most helpful TA I&#039;ve had thus far in any of my courses. He was always available and responded to e-mails quickly. He cared about students and knew the names of students who came to office hours. Even if students had really simple questions, he would answer and then show how to progress our learning from there. All in all, most of the students could not have survived the course without him.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Post solutions to homework and exams. Professor doesn&#039;t allow posting the solutions.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>None. TA grades fairly, knows his stuff, always helpful even off office hours. Best TA for this course.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The TA was probably the hardest working TA I have ever had in a course. The professor didn&#039;t really seem to do as much work except type up packets, but the TA was where I got a majority of help from. I appreciate all of your hard work, dedication, and positive attitude towards helping each student try to learn the material. Keep up the great work</q></p></blockquote><hr></div>
