<p><strong>What do you like best about this course?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>None</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>All of the TAs for this class did a fantastic job of communicating with their students. Multiple times I&#039;ve sent emails either with quick questions or complex ones and would always get a response in less than 10 minutes with a very detailed response.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The way the Lab TA made sure everyone was able to complete their report.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Nothing, it was terrible. We should focus more on implementing components into applicable circuits, (ie. Diode - Power Supply), NOT just prove I-V characteristic.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I really enjoyed the topics covered.</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>In what ways, if any, has this course or the instructor encouraged your intellectual growth and progress?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>None</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The TAs helped me conceptualize and understand topics that I wasn&#039;t 100% sure on.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>It hasn&#039;t. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>N/A</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>If you were teaching this course, what would you do differently?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>None</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Nothing, great job!</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Make sure I know what I&#039;m doing before helping someone else out.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The most annoying part about this lab was the manual. It is very old and needs to be updated. Additionally, the PSPICE project manual needs a lot of updating as well. I think that the PSPICE project manual first should be updated to reflect the current software we use. Next, I think that errors need to be fixed, such as in problem 1-2, the clipper circuit, which shows resistors of 15 and 2 Ohm, but they should be 15k and 2k. Lastly, I really think that the PSPICE manual needs to have improved directions. It gives us circuits and maybe one type of analysis to complete, but it needs to be more specific about what the project goal is. Basically a more standardized format for each question.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Since the lab and course were not on the same pace, i would have given better overviews of the lab and what the lab covers. </q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>Other comments or suggestions:</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>None</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The only complaint I had about this lab class wasn&#039;t with the TAs but with the layout itself. The lab ran ahead of the material in the course. For example, we did the MOSFET lab (lab 6) over a week before we even started the chapter.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>ta understood students difficulty in the course and helped </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Whenever a circuit or something isn&#039;t working and we can&#039;t figure it out, we call him over and he can&#039;t figure out what&#039;s wrong either. That&#039;s fine, BUT when he can&#039;t fix the problem, and then takes off points for incorrect measurements, I find this a bit annoying. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Honestly, Jian Qing Liu was an excellent T/A. He cared about the students&#039; success and he worked hard to help us when we needed it. Any shortfalls in the course were in no way his fault.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The lab needs to be aligned with the course material. I was in the first section for the lab, so the lab was always ahead by a lot compared to the lectures. Other than that, the TA was helpful when I went to office hours.  </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>These labs are terrible. They do not line up with the course. They are beyond dry, results are never what is expected. I didn&#039;t learn anything. Why have they not been updated for so long? No instruction for PSPICE is ever given even though expectations are continually increased. Maybe try building circuits that actually do something instead of measuring I-V characteristics 1000 times and plugging and chugging equations for hours on end.</q></p></blockquote><hr></div>
